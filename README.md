## 📌 Snapshot

- 🧠 <strong>AI engineering:</strong> Building agentic and RAG-based systems with LangGraph, Neo4j, and modern TypeScript tooling.
- 💼 <strong>Financial planning and wealth:</strong> Chartered Financial Planner trainee, Financial Planning & Wealth Management Professional (FPWMP®) candidate, and Financial Planning & Analysis Professional (FPAP) candidate.
- 🏗 <strong>Product:</strong> Shipping <strong>FinCoach.me</strong>, a platform where planners and clients share one source of truth for goals, net worth, and cash flow, supported by AI.
- 🎓 <strong>Academics:</strong> Business & Commerce (Entrepreneurship) with a finance minor, integrating formal financial theory with applied AI.
- 📈 <strong>Trajectory:</strong> Deliberately building deep competence by combining regulated designations, structured AI training, and shipped products, rather than claiming finished expertise and we keep learning.

## 🚀 What I am building

### FinCoach.me – AI-first financial coaching workspace

A unified workspace where financial planners and clients:

- Run structured intake, cash-flow, and net-worth analysis.
- Collaborate on goals, tasks, and financial “journeys”.
- Use AI agents for explanations, projections, and next-step suggestions, while preserving human judgment and regulatory constraints.

<em>Status:</em> Private early-stage product. Built with TypeScript, Next.js, Convex, Clerk, Tailwind, LangGraph, and Vercel AI SDK.

---

### ContextEngine (under-development) – Domain-aware context and knowledge engine

An experimental architecture for powering domain-specific AI agents (starting with personal finance):

- Knowledge-graph centric, using Neo4j and Cypher.
- Workflow and state management through LangGraph.
- Designed to become the “context layer” behind products like FinCoach.me.

<em>Status:</em> Design and prototype phase; selected ideas gradually move into FinCoach.me.

## 📚 Professional Tracks

### AI Engineering Track

I approach AI engineering as a long-term craft. The Scrimba AI Engineering Career Path, the LangGraph project, and my own experiments serve as formal scaffolding, but the principal evidence is the architecture and behaviour of systems such as FinCoach.me and ContextEngine.

### Financial Planning, Wealth Management, and FP&A Track

I am a **Chartered Financial Planner trainee** in Ontario, Canada, where the “Financial Planner” title is regulated, and I am pursuing complementary tracks in wealth management and FP&A.

- **Financial Planning & Wealth Management Professional (FPWMP®) – in progress**  
  Building breadth across:
  - The 7-step financial planning process and holistic plan design  
  - Risk management and insurance, estate, education, and retirement planning  
  - Investment management, including Investment Policy Statements (IPS), asset allocation, and mandate construction  
  - Practice management: pricing, business management, and team building for a planning or wealth practice  
  - Relationship management, effective communication, and working with client concerns  
  - Modern client acquisition, including sales process, pipeline development, centres of influence, and referrals  

- **Financial Planning & Analysis Professional (FPAP) – in progress**  
  Focusing on analytical and organisational finance:
  - FP&A model design and monthly forecasting frameworks  
  - Budgeting, rolling forecasts, and variance analysis across financial statements  
  - Year-over-year performance analysis, seasonality, and timing of forecast updates  
  - Executive-ready financial commentary for non-financial stakeholders  
  - Dashboard design and financial storytelling through clear, focused visuals  
  - Workflow streamlining, economic thinking, and cross-functional influence in decision-making  

My broader aim is to stand at the intersection of regulated financial planning, wealth management, FP&A, and applied AI, so that the tools I build respect both human judgment and regulatory frameworks while remaining analytically rigorous.

---

### Academic Track

- **Business & Commerce (Entrepreneurship)** – undergraduate studies in Toronto, with a finance minor  
- Coursework in economics, accounting, corporate finance, and quantitative methods, informing both product strategy and financial planning work.
